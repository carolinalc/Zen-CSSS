    <h2>The Road to Enlightenment</h2>
    <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific <br>
       tags, incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and abandoned <br> browsers. <br> <br>

       We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been <br>
       achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the W3C, WaSP, <br>
       and the major browser creators. <br> <br>
      
       The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important <br>
       lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the <br>
       time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with  <br>
       the web.</p>

    <h2>So What is This About?</h2>
    <p> There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden <br>
        aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some<br>
        of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style<br>
        sheet into this very page. The HTML remains the same, the only thing that<br>
        has changed is the external CSS file. Yes, really.<br><br>

        CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext <br>
        document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people<br>
        excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed<br>
        in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and<br>
        coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always<br>
        push it further.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="r4">
    <h2>Participation</h2>
    <p>Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this <br>
      page, so strong CSS skills are necessary too, but the example files are <br>
      commented well enough that even CSS novices can use them as starting <br>
      points. Please see the <a href="">CSS Resource Guide</a> for advanced tutorials and <br>
      tips on working with CSS.<br><br>

      You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML.<br>
      This may seem daunting at first if you’ve never worked this way before,<br>
      but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.<br><br>
      
      Download the sample <a href="">HTML</a> and <a href="">CSS</a> to work on a copy locally. Once you <br>
      have completed your masterpiece (and please, don’t submit half-finished work)<br>
      upload your CSS file to a web server under your control. <a href="">Send us a link</a><br>
      to an archive of that file and all associated assets, and if we choose to<br>
      use it we will download it and place it on our server.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="r5">
    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <p>Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all<br>
       refer to showing people how amazing CSS really can be. This site serves as <br>
       equal parts inspiration for those working on the web today, learning tool for <br>
       those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we can all look <br>
       forward to.</p>
